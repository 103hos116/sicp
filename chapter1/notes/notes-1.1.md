#1.1 The Elements of Programming

A program is a set of rules which are used to direct the evolution of a process.
A programming language makes it possible for a programmer to express procedural thoughts.
In CS, there is not difference between what can be build and what can be imagined. The consteaints to building computer systems are the limits of our minds.
Foundational things to understand in a programming language are:
    - Primitive elements
    - Means of abstraction
    - Means of combination
The mathematical convention of evaluating a combination is to place the operator in between two operands. whereas in lisp, the idea of prefix notation is used, whereby, the operator is placed to the left of the operands.
